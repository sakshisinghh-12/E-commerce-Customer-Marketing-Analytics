# E-commerce-Customer-Marketing-Analytics

This project presents an end-to-end data analysis of an e-commerce business, focusing on customer behaviour, marketing performance, pricing strategy, and profitability. The goal was to identify actionable insights that improve conversion, customer retention, and sustainable revenue growth.

## Business Problem

The company experienced strong traffic growth but lacked visibility into conversion efficiency, marketing ROI, and long-term customer value. Leadership wanted to answer key strategic questions:

- Which marketing channels drive high-quality customers?

- How do pricing and discount strategies affect profitability?

- What is the impact of customer retention on revenue growth?

- Which product categories contribute most to business performance?

- How can the company balance customer acquisition and profitability?

## Dataset

The analysis integrates multiple datasets to simulate a real-world e-commerce environment:

- Customer demographics and signup behaviour

- Website traffic and marketing channel attribution

- Order and transaction data

- Product cost and category information

- Pricing, discount, and profitability metrics

These datasets enable a complete funnel view from acquisition to revenue and profit.
